The SARS-CoV-2 surveillance program was strengthened among migrants arriving in Italy. However, few screening measures for SARS-CoV2 infection have been conducted on the foreign population already present in Italy. In Tuscany, a great effort was made to know the epidemiological features of coronavirus outbreaksÂ in the foreigners. Based on these premises, this study describes the prevalence and characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection in foreigners present in the Tuscan territory during the months of the highest incidence of this pandemic.",
